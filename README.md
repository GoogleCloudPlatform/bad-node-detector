# Shared Testing Directory

This directory contains code for test that are shared between different teams.
The tests in this directory will be designed to be used in different scenarios
and can be used by anyone.

The two primary dependencies on the tests is ASQ and BND, and therefore changes
made to the test will need to be approved by those teams to ensure it doesn't
break their use case.
